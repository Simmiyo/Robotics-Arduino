- Homework no2: I connected three potentiometers to the Arduino board in order to read their values in my program. After that, I placed an RGB led on the breadboard and tied it through wires with the power source. Each potentiometer is in charge with one of the led's colors, being able to set the intensity of light emmited by the led in the respective hue. By doing so, I would be able to control every color distinctly.
