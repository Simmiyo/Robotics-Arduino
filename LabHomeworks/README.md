- Homework no2: I connected three potentiometers to the Arduino board in order to read their values in my program. After that, I placed an RGB led on the breadboard and tied it through wires with the power source. Each potentiometer is in charge with one of the led's colors, being able to set the intensity of light emmited by the led in the respective hue. By doing so, I would be able to control every color distinctly.  

- Homework no3: I created a sound detector, structered in two phases, which uses two Piezzo buzzers. In phase entitled "before", the passive buzzer senses a knock produced nearby. After exactly 5 seconds, a signal is sent to the active buzzer, which starts playing a song, making the program enter in the phase called "after". The Piezzo continues playing the song, repeating it it as many times as wanted, and only stops when the push button is pressed. As the melody is turned of the detector is brought agin to phase "before", waiting once again to feel a knock.
